# PythonPongGame
This is a repository for the storage of all assets of an underdevelopment Pong Game, created using python.

Python is an incredibly strong programming language, and however difficult it may look, it's the easiest.
This repository has been created in order to manage all the assets of a pong game that I am developing using python and pygame.
Pygame is a python module, which allows us to develop games easily and include inevitably important gaming components like sound effects and shapes, fairly easily.

The game that is bieng developed is a pong game. A pong game is a table tennis themed game which contains two paddles opposite to each other at a specific distance. At the centre is a ball. The ball bounces in random directions, and once coming to the paddle, the players have to hit it and trick the other one to actually missing the ball, in order to gain a point. The one with the higher number of points wins.
This repository will contain the python code and as well as the sprites and sound effects!!
